The File to use is called: Assignment2.c

ON A LINUX SYSTEM (HOW TO RUN ON OS1)

If it is not already, the header ''#include <conio.h>'' must be commented out with two forward slashes (//)

The file can be compiled with the following statement:

"gcc -std=c99 -o [name to call the executable, i.e. Assignment1] Assignment2.c"

Then it can be run with:

"./[executable file name]"

Note: There are warnings that appear in the LINUX-compiled version of this that do not appear in the windows version. It does not
seem to impact the performance of the program.
