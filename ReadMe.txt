The File to use is called: ConsoleApplication1

My apologies on the funky naming, I could've changed it, but this was my first foray into C and once things started rolling, I didn't want to mess them up.

This program is made to run with Visual Studio, though the C file can be extracted and compiled with GCC, etc. like any other C file. What is
being submitted is the entire solution, so that it can be opened by clicking on ConsoleApplication1.sln, saved, then run with the command:

"cl ConsoleApplication1.c" 

Then: 

"ConsoleApplication1 [csv file that exactly mimics the example file (in terms of styling)]"


This file must be in the same directory as the ConsoleApplication, else the path must be specified to it.

If the file is to be extracted, it may be compiled through the methods specified in the Assignment 1 Resources Section.

This was tested extensively with the included sample CSV file, as well as after I made some mods to my own version and tested different values. Please let me know
if there is trouble compiling as I will 1: try to figure out why it was corrupted, or 2: move the code over to VS Code and run it through the methods specified 
in some of the resources.
